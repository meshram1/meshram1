-  Hi, I’m Aditya Meshram
- I’m interested in simulating Multiphase and two-phase flows, Dispersed Flows, Conjugate Heat Transfer in two-phase flows, and VOF methods for interfacial tracking. 
- I’m currently learning heat transfer in two-phase flows, primarily free surface flows with microlayers in nucleate boiling modeled as explicitly resolved.
