-  Hi, I’m Aditya Meshram
- Involved in simulating Multiphase, Two-Phase Dispersed Flows. My Research interests include but are not limited to Particle Tracking in Coupled Flows, Conjugate Heat Transfer, and VOF methods for Interfacial Tracking.
- I’m currently working on **conjugate heat transfer in two-phase flows**, primarily within the microlayer in nucleate boiling, which is being modeled as explicitly resolved.
