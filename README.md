- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aditya Meshram
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in simulating Multiphase and two-phase flows, Dispersed Flows, Conjugate Heat Transfer in two-phase flows, and VOF methods for interfacial tracking. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning heat transfer in two-phase flows primarily free surface flows with microlayer in nucleate boiling modeled as explicitly resolved.
